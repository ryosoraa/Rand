    "Article": "When Ohio's cannabis ballot initiative passed in November, the United States crossed a new threshold. More than half of Americans now live in states, including New York, that have passed laws allowing commercial production and retail sales of cannabis to adults for nonmedical purposes. Liberalization of drug laws is not stopping with cannabis. Some states and localities are also loosening or considering changing their policies about psychedelic substances such as “magic” mushrooms containing psilocybin. Some decisionmakers may think cannabis provides a useful template for liberalizing drug laws. But psychedelics are very different substances. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized several clinical trials evaluating psychedelics to treat certain mental health conditions. Some formulations of psychedelics could be available in clinical settings as soon as 2024 (PDF). While this medical research receives a lot of publicity, it's not prescribed medical use where the state- and city-level legal changes are focused. Rather, the moves are toward allowing psychedelics to be used for any reason.… The remainder of this commentary is available at vitalcitynyc.org.
