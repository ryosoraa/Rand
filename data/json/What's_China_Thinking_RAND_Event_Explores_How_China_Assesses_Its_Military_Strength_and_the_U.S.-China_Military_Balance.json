        "What": "RAND will host an event Thursday, March 2, to discuss findings of the new report “Gaining Victory in Systems Warfare: China's Perspective on the U.S.-China Military Balance.” The report is one of the first to detail and explore how the People's Liberation Army (PLA) assesses military balance and finds that the PLA still sees itself as the weaker side in the overall military balance. Despite some strengths and improvements from decades of modernization, the PLA has only made limited progress in key areas that will define future wars such as informatization, joint operations, and systems warfare. The event will take a closer look at these findings and explore how the PLA's assessments may impact the potential for a great power conflict over Taiwan."
