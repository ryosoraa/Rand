        "title": "What Can the U.S. Military Learn from the War in Ukraine?",
        "descriptions": "When other countries fight a war using American military equipment and tactics—as is the case in Ukraine today—policymakers have a window to gain insights into whether U.S. defense investments have paid off. The United States last had such a window in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, also known as the Yom Kippur War, when Israel's near-defeat prompted a thorough reexamination of U.S. military weapons and strategy. The Yom Kippur War led to a new doctrine and continues to shape how the U.S. military plans for the future. According to RAND's Raphael Cohen and Gian Gentile, Russia's war in Ukraine once again poses questions about how the United States prepares for conflict—not only which weapons it buys, but also how it envisions great-power wars in the 21st century. For example, how relevant is the tank? Do helicopters still have a place on the modern battlefield? Will future wars be short, sharp affairs or grinding, protracted struggles? If the United States does learn the lessons of this war, as it did after the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago, then it may secure the U.S. military's edge for decades to come, Cohen and Gentile say. But if it doesn't, it may not get a second chance.",

Cooper/U.S. Army The United States and France share goals in the Indo-Pacific, including promoting free access in the region and preventing nuclear proliferation. Washington, however, seems to overlook France as an Indo-Pacific power. A new report by RAND's Stephanie Pezard identifies ways the U.S. Army can further cooperate with France in the region. These include increased information-sharing, combined partnerships with other countries, and participation in joint exercises and training.",

        "descriptions": "Software supply chain security is a top concern for private companies and government agencies. But given the tremendous number of open-source software packages and libraries, estimating and reducing this risk is a big challenge. Solutions start with filling in the “massive gap in our understanding of software dependency,” says RAND's Sasha Romanosky. Fortunately, the data needed to map out the extensive network of open-source software already exists.",

For example, the White House does not have a viable economic strategy, and its emphasis on containing China could alienate key countries in the region. But as long as the U.S.-China competition does not boil over, then Southeast Asian states will feel comfortable deepening their ties with Washington.",

RAND's Robert Lempert explains that, while there's no crystal ball, there are tools that can help. Lempert's work uses powerful modeling to stress-test policies that address critical issues such as climate change. “Think of it as peering into the multiverse,” he says, with “humans and computers working together to look at thousands and thousands of futures.”",
