        "descriptions": "Americans are living longer and retiring later. As these trends continue, the workforce might experience a higher prevalence of dementia than in past generations. This could have serious implications in the national security and intelligence communities. But, up until now, there has not been any publicly available research on the topic. A new RAND paper provides the first look at what appears to be an emerging security blind spot: Individuals who hold or held a security clearance and handled classified material could develop dementia and unwittingly share government secrets. How might the national security community assess this risk and address the potential threat?",

According to RAND Europe's Charlotte Kleberg and James Black, Finland's experience assessing Russian capabilities and intentions makes it key to defending what is now the alliance's longest land border with Russia. As for Sweden, a long-term delay in its membership could leave NATO's northern flank more vulnerable to attack.",

Recent RAND research shows that students in four-day districts fell behind a little every year. These small changes accumulate. Our researchers estimate that, after eight years, the damage to student achievement could equal that caused by the pandemic. District leaders must consider whether the benefits of a shorter school week outweigh the drawbacks.",

This week, Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in California, opting not to make the trip overseas. According to RAND's Derek Grossman, the decision to remain stateside may not deter Chinese aggression. In fact, he says, it could do the opposite if Beijing concludes “acting assertively against Taiwan, as it did after the Pelosi visit, bears fruit.”",

This makes China's near-total domination of the rare earth market both an economic and national security concern. In a recent study, RAND researchers looked at how the United States might break its reliance on China for these critical but hard-to-source materials. What's most important, they concluded, is for U.S. policymakers to act quickly; investments made today could take a decade or more to yield results.",

And there's little reason to expect concise conflicts in the future, say RAND experts. As a matter of defense planning, the United States should assume that any war it fights will be protracted. “The only thing worse than fighting a long war may be thinking it's possible to avoid one,” they say.",
