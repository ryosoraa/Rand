        "title": "Opioids in America: It's Time for a New Approach",
        "descriptions": "Fatal overdoses in the United States have increased steadily in recent years, largely because of the proliferation of illicit synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. But drug fatalities aren't the only negative outcomes linked to opioid use. People struggling with addiction and their families can face a slew of physical, psychological, emotional, and financial consequences. The crisis is complex, but one thing is clear: America's opioid problem requires an urgent, comprehensive response. In a sweeping report released today, RAND researchers recommend moving away from the siloed thinking traditionally used to tackle this issue. Instead, adopting an ecosystem approach could help significantly reduce opioid addiction, overdose, and other harms. People who use opioids and their families are at the center of RAND's ecosystem concept. We interviewed Pattie Vargas, whose late son Joel struggled with opioid use disorder. Her family's deeply personal story reflects the urgent need for holistic support. Our researchers also created a tool to help policymakers explore our ecosystem framework and develop new solutions to address the problem. “Continuing to treat fentanyl and other synthetic opioids just like previous drug problems will likely be insufficient and may condemn thousands more to early deaths,” says RAND's Beau Kilmer, coeditor of the report. “We needed this response years ago—but there's still time to get it right and save lives.”",

        "descriptions": "Photo by Brittany Hosea-Small/Reuters Last week, the decidedly modern Silicon Valley Bank succumbed to a very old problem: a bank run. SVB's failure is the largest since Washington Mutual went under in 2008. The spread of information on social media often accelerates modern-day collapses, RAND's Jonathan Welburn explains. And as a result, markets can shift in ways that are divorced from fundamentals. The mixture of technology and quick-spreading beliefs may be ushering in a new era of “viral financial panic.”",

According to RAND's Samuel Charap, the collision may have been an accident, but Russia's likely intent was to make a “close pass” and create risk for U.S. drone operators. Charap recently led a study that examines Russia's history of such behavior—defined as coercive signaling.",

This move reflects Australia's strategy to project power beyond its shores. Prior to this week's announcement about the submarines, RAND experts wrote that Australia's approach fails to consider the strategic calculus of nearby Southeast Asian nations. Australia may want to “seek impactful engagement before seeking impactful projection,” they say.",

The research team is now working with other small communities to develop early warning systems for landslides, floods, and other hazards.",
