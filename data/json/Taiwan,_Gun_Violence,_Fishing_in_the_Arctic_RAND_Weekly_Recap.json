        "descriptions": "It's essential for U.S. decisionmakers to understand Taiwan's ability to sustain a defense against a potential invasion by Beijing. A new RAND report examines this topic, assessing key factors that affect a country's ability to resist a large-scale military attack. The authors find that, without a robust U.S. military intervention, China's enormous advantage in military resources would likely allow it to eventually subjugate the island. That's why U.S. officials should continue to help Taiwan strengthen its military and counter Chinese information operations and economic coercion. Importantly, the report also notes that the speed, clarity, and credibility of any pledged U.S. military support could be a critical factor in sustaining Taiwan's ability to resist a Chinese incursion.",

Meanwhile, residents of Highland Park, Illinois, mourned those who were killed one year ago when a gunman opened fire during an Independence Day parade. These tragedies are yet another reminder of America's unacceptably high rates of gun violence. Since 2018, the RAND Gun Policy in America initiative has analyzed scientific evidence to support the development of fair and effective gun policies—and help save lives.",

What will become of the tens of thousands of fighters he leads? RAND's Molly Dunigan expects that few will quit. Most Wagner mercenaries joined up for a paycheck or for a ticket out of jail. Thus, they will likely remain loyal to Prigozhin—or his successor—not because they want to but because they have few better options.",

Research often zooms in on specific aspects of the opioid crisis, such as the police response or the lack of treatment options. But a recent RAND study zoomed out, approaching it as an ecosystem where all parts of the crisis are interconnected. Viewing the problem in this way reveals barriers that may not be apparent otherwise. It also highlights the need for innovative solutions that can reduce the harms associated with opioid use.",

But according to a recent RAND study, providing counsel can decrease the use of monetary bail and pretrial detention. These findings are especially significant because pretrial detention is associated with worse outcomes for defendants—and society—including longer jail stays and higher chances of conviction in the short term, as well as lower employment and higher rates of rearrest over the long term.",

According to RAND's Katherine Anania, when this happens, a combination of overfishing and climate change may lead to the collapse of multiple fish stocks, decreasing supply and increasing prices. At the same time, demand is expected to keep rising. A multilateral fisheries management plan can help, Anania says. This would boost economic and food security, whereas a lack of coordination could result in conflict and further environmental degradation.",
