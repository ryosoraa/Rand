        "title": "Could AI Be Misused to Plan Biological Attacks?",
        "descriptions": "Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly—with serious implications. For example, biological attacks that failed in the past because of a lack of knowledge might succeed in a world in which bad actors can use AI tools to bridge the information gap. A new preliminary study by RAND researchers explores this risk, focusing particularly on how large language models, or LLMs, could aid in carrying out a biological attack. The study employs red teams—experts pretending to be malicious actors—to scrutinize LLMs across various fictional scenarios. In one scenario, the red teams asked an LLM about how to obtain and distribute specimens infected with Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that causes plague. In another, they asked the LLM for a cover story that could be used to help acquire Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism. Initial findings show that LLMs can produce concerning outputs that could assist in planning a biological attack. However, it remains to be seen whether the capabilities of existing LLMs represent a new level of threat beyond the harmful information that is readily available online.",

In the interview, he discusses the importance of preventing civilian casualties, the challenges posed by Hamas’s vast network of tunnels, and the tough choices ahead for Israel. “I think they can effectively destroy Hamas,” he said. “But there's going to be a lot of hard fighting and a lot of destruction. And then the question after they defeat Hamas is, what comes next?”",

The findings reveal that veteran households are generally better off than comparable nonveteran households. But that difference goes away among low-income households. Also, some veteran populations, such as women and renters, are more likely to experience housing cost burden. This may suggest areas to focus on moving forward.",

Many students can then “stack” these credentials and enroll in higher-level coursework, leading to gains in earnings (especially if students go on to earn a degree).
