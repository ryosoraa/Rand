        "title": "What If Russia Were to Attack NATO?",
        "descriptions": "U.S. and NATO leaders have long focused on preparing for a potential large-scale conflict with Russia. But the Ukraine war has created a set of circumstances that make a more limited Russian attack plausible. A new RAND paper explores this possibility, considering what U.S. policymakers might do if faced with a limited Russian attack on U.S. or allied targets. The authors break down a range of hypothetical scenarios—from a one-off strike on an isolated military target to a barrage of missile attacks against multiple civilian and military sites—and consider both Western responses and Russian reactions.",

        "descriptions": "Photo by SFC Kelvin Ringold/U.S. Army More than one-quarter of active-duty military personnel have faced some level of food insecurity. That's according to a new RAND study. Survey data shows that military members experiencing food insecurity were more likely to be early- to mid-career enlisted personnel, single with children, married without children, or members of racial or ethnic minority populations. They also were disproportionately in the Army and, to a lesser extent, the Navy. To address these high rates of food insecurity, it's essential to learn more about the root causes of the problem.",

But a recent RAND report finds that, despite these efforts, Beijing has made limited progress. The authors acknowledge that the United States views China's Arctic ambitions as potentially destabilizing, but there may be opportunities for the two countries to work together on key issues affecting the region, including climate change.",

        "descriptions": "Whether or not someone is “middle class” is typically determined by income. According to RAND's George Zuo, the problem with this approach is that it ignores how much of one's income is eaten up by necessities. In other words, many households may earn what's considered a middle-class income, but they can't maintain a middle-class lifestyle. And inflation only makes the problem worse.",

According to RAND's Bruce Bennett, this capability offers much-needed support for South Korea. In the event of a conflict, Japanese destruction of even one North Korean nuclear weapon could save at least tens of thousands of South Korean lives. “Japan's and South Korea's fates are inextricably linked when it comes to North Korea,” Bennett says.",
