        "title": "NATO Summit Highlights Key to Ukrainian Reconstruction",
        "descriptions": "Security decisions made at this week's NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, are essential to Ukraine's fight against Russia. But, as RAND experts wrote in the Los Angeles Times, such decisions will be just as important—if not more so—after the war ends. In other words, they will “set the tone” for Ukraine's reconstruction. NATO members have a range of options to support Ukraine's rebuilding efforts. To start, they could extend current arrangements of providing military support to Ukraine, which the G7 affirmed through a joint declaration on Wednesday. Stronger still, they could threaten to introduce Western forces into Ukraine. Or, they could bring Ukraine into NATO—a step that a number of allies pledged to take this week, without providing specifics on timing. Whatever happens next, further “clarifying security arrangements and moving toward firm postwar security assurances” will be vital to Ukraine's reconstruction success.",

        "descriptions": "Photo by Marko Djurica/Reuters Many expected Russia's invasion of Ukraine to last only a matter of weeks. Instead, Moscow faltered against a strong Ukrainian resistance and committed a series of missteps. Why has Russia stumbled so significantly? A new RAND report finds that poor planning and lack of capacity in logistics and sustainment are partly responsible, as they left Russian soldiers without the means to fight and likely affected morale. This may be a cautionary tale for any force planning a prolonged fight, the authors write.",

        "descriptions": "One year after the reversal of Roe v. Wade, about half of all women serving in the active-duty U.S. military have limited access to reproductive health care. According to RAND experts, these restrictions could lead more women to turn away from military service altogether. This is especially worrying in an already-difficult recruiting environment, they say, and it could have an effect on national security.",

The country banned the film because it includes a map featuring the controversial nine-dash line, which indicates China's claims to disputed territory in the South China Sea. A 2022 RAND paper provides a primer on this complex issue, reviewing the history of territorial claims—and the risks of ongoing militarization—in this important region.",

        "descriptions": "This spring, RAND surveyed 150 superintendents in school districts across the country to learn more about their job-related stress. The vast majority of respondents—79 percent—said that their work was often or always stressful. Superintendents most commonly cited “the intrusion of political issues or opinions into schooling” as a source of that stress. Notably, most said their jobs are worth the stress and disappointments.",

Even though the deal has formally expired, the halt in fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition has mostly held. The importance of this truce should not be understated, says RAND's Alexandra Stark. However, ending the war in Yemen for good will require continued engagement from U.S. and other diplomats, as well as a peace process that includes all parts of Yemeni society.",
