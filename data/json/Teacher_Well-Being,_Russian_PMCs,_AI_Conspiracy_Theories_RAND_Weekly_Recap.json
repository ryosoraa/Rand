But Wagner isn't alone. The war has also led to the expansion of other private military companies—and the founding of new ones. RAND experts say this “explosion of what are essentially private armies” could have devastating impacts. Ultimately, the Ukraine war may be a catalyst for bloodshed elsewhere in the world at the hands of Russian PMCs.",

This has led some states and cities to change their laws—a shift akin to what began decades ago with medical cannabis. This time around, the changes are happening much faster, say RAND experts. And as more states and localities liberalize their approach to the supply and use of psychedelics, federal policymakers will face mounting pressure to address tough policy questions.",

Artificial intelligence is no different, says RAND's Douglas Yeung. In fact, AI is “ready-made for conspiratorial thinking.” Thus, it's important not only to track AI conspiracy theories, but also to actively counter misinformation. “The time to do this is now,” Yeung says, “before conspiracy theories take hold in the minds of the public.”",

        "descriptions": "Photo by Latin America News Agency via Reuters According to RAND experts, America's strategy in Ukraine is a case in which the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Individually, most U.S. decisions make sense. For instance, it's logical for Washington to be opaque about its goals in the conflict and hesitant to provide Kyiv with high-end weapons. But when judged collectively, these decisions add up to a “messy” strategy for supporting a war. Thankfully, Ukraine can still win, they say, but the United States “needs the will and strategy to embrace that victory.”",
