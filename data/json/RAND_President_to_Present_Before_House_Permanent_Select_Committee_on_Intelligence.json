        "What": "His presentation will focus on two significant threats to national security—advances in synthetic biology and artificial intelligence. These technologies create significant challenges because of their rate of progress and the broad scope of their applications. While both have the potential to transform entire industries, the United States is unprepared for the national security risks they pose. Matheny will offer several recommendations for structural reforms that the intelligence community could take to mitigate these risks."
