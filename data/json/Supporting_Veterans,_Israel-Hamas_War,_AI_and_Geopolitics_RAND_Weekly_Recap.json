This resource highlights information on veteran demographics, mental health, labor market outcomes, and more. Here are some of the noteworthy findings: These findings and others from our factbook can help shape policies that address veterans’ needs, close gaps in support, and foster better understanding of the veteran population and their families.",

        "descriptions": "Photo by Ilan Rosenberg/Reuters Weeks after terrorist attacks left 1,400 Israelis dead, Israel began its ground offensive in Gaza. According to RAND's Raphael Cohen, this campaign could offer Israel the chance to wrest the Gaza Strip from Hamas's control, potentially breaking the cycle of wars that has plagued the region for almost two decades. But it’s essential to acknowledge the limitations of the operation, Cohen says. “Achieving a long-term solution in Gaza will require that Israel's ground offensive be followed by what will be an equally intensive and arguably more challenging task: rebuilding.”",

Social media companies could and should do more to moderate the virality of such content.”",

RAND researchers conducted a survey to learn more about how principals and school district leaders partner with STEM organizations to conduct such programs. Notably, respondents want to be able to offer more STEM afterschool programming, but they say that it's challenging to find high-quality providers—and the funding to pay for them.",
