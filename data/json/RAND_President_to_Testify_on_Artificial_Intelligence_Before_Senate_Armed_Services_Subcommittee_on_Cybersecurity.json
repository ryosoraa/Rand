        "What": "Matheny's testimony will focus on how the Department of Defense (DoD) can best ensure that progress in AI benefits, rather than degrades, U.S. national security. He will also discuss China's goal to become the world's primary AI innovation driver by 2030 and how the militarization of AI technologies by both China and Russia may exacerbate national security challenges. Matheny will highlight specific actions that DoD could take in response to national security challenges, including tracking developments in AI that could affect cyber defense and cyber offense, preventing bad actors from having access to advanced AI systems, expanding intelligence on adversary states involved in AI, recruiting private-sector experts for government service, and investing in potential moonshots for AI security."
